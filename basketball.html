                            <p style="text-align: left;">Basketball is one of the most popular sports in North America. It was invented by a Canadian physical education teacher in 1891. Basketball was conceived as a safe sport compared to the more physical sports like football. Basketball is also one of the cheaper sports to play as players don't need the expensive equipment that is required for many other sports.</p>

The local team, London Lightning, is based here in London and play at the Budweiser Gardens - the same arena in which the Knights hockey team plays.</p>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">The Lightning have won the NBLC championship both in 2022 and 2023 and now have 6 championships in total!</p>

                                <p style="text-align: left;">The Toronto Raptors are the only Canadian basketball team in the NBA (National Basketball Association) and they play in Scotiabank Arena - the same arena in which the Maple Leafs hockey team plays.</p>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">Also similar to the Leafs, the Raptors struggled in the playoffs even in years when they did very well during the regular season. They were eliminated in the first or second round on several occasions in recent years.</p>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">However, in 2019, things were different for the Raptors. They progressed through the different series all the way to the final round, which was against the extremely talented Golden State Warriors. Although they were up against a challenging team with experience winning such championships, the Raptors managed to win that series to achieve their first-ever championship. Kyle Lowry and Kawhi Leonard were arguably the two most important players on the team that year that led them to the championship. Unfortunately, Leonard left the team soon after and they have gone into rebuilding mode.</p>

                            <li style="text-align: left;">The highest-scoring game in NBA history occurred on December 13, 1983, when the Detroit Pistons faced the Denver Nuggets. The game ended with a score of 186-184 in favor of the Pistons after triple overtime. This high-scoring game is often referred to as the "Pistons vs. Nuggets game" and is known for its incredible point total.</li>
                            <li style="text-align: left;">Basketball was invented by Dr. James Naismith in December 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts, USA. Naismith was trying to create a new indoor game to keep his students active during the winter months, and he hung a soccer ball in a gymnasium and developed the basic rules of the game we know today.</li>
                            <li style="text-align: left;">Michael Jordan, widely considered one of the greatest basketball players of all time, won six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls during the 1990s. His dominance and impact on the sport helped popularize basketball worldwide and solidified his status as an iconic figure in the game.</li>
